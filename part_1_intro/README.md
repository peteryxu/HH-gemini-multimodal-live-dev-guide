# Part 1: Introduction to Google Gemini AI

This section provides a foundational introduction to working with Google's Gemini AI model through practical examples and hands-on code.

## Contents

### Chapter 1: SDK Basics
- Introduction to the Google Gemini AI SDK
- Setting up the development environment
- Basic text interactions with Gemini
- Audio response generation examples
- Examples using both direct API key authentication and Vertex AI authentication

### Chapter 2: Multimodal Interactions
- Real-time audio conversations with Gemini
- Streaming audio input and output
- Voice activity detection and turn-taking
- Example implementation of an interactive voice chat

## Key Features Covered
- Text generation and conversations
- Audio output generation
- Real-time streaming interactions
- Different authentication methods (API key and Vertex AI)
- Multimodal capabilities (text-to-audio, audio-to-audio)

## Prerequisites
- Python environment
- Google Gemini API access
- Required packages:
  - `google-genai`
  - `pyaudio` (for audio examples)

## Getting Started
Each chapter contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate different aspects of the Gemini AI capabilities. Start with Chapter 1's notebooks for basic SDK usage before moving on to the more advanced multimodal examples in Chapter 2.
