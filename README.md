# Gemini Multimodal Live API Developer Guide

![Gemini API Developer Guide](assets/mm_live_api.jpg)

This repository serves as a comprehensive developer guide for Google's Gemini Multimodal Live API. It provides a hands-on, example-driven approach to understanding and utilizing the API's capabilities for building real-time, interactive applications. The guide is structured into chapters, each focusing on a specific aspect of the API, progressing from basic SDK usage to low-level WebSocket interactions.

## Repository Structure

The guide is divided into chapters that progressively introduce different aspects of the Gemini Multimodal Live API. **Chapters 1 and 2 utilize the Python SDK (`google-genai`) to provide an initial understanding of interacting with the API. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 then shift to using JavaScript and the low-level WebSocket API directly in the browser.**

**Why the Switch to JavaScript and WebSockets?**

While the Python SDK offers a convenient way to interact with the Gemini API, this guide deliberately transitions to JavaScript and WebSockets to facilitate the development of **real-time, browser-based applications**. WebSockets are the native browser technology for real-time, bidirectional communication, making them essential for interactive experiences like live audio chat and text-to-speech. Python is just not ideal for browser front-ends: While we can technically use Python for web development (e.g., with frameworks like Flask or Django), it's not the natural choice for front-end, browser-based interactions, especially real-time audio processing within the browser itself.

Using JavaScript allows us to seamlessly integrate these features directly into the browser environment. Furthermore, understanding the low-level WebSocket interaction provides a **deeper understanding of the API's communication protocol** and offers **greater flexibility and control** for specialized use cases or integrations not fully supported by the SDK.

## Detailed Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following chapters:

*   **[`chapter_01`](chapter_01)**: **Introduction to the Google Gemini SDK**
    *   This chapter provides a gentle introduction to interacting with the Gemini model using the official Google Gemini SDK (`google-genai` Python package).
    *   It demonstrates simple text and audio interactions using the SDK's high-level abstractions.
    *   You'll find a Jupyter Notebook ([`sdk-intro.ipynb`](chapter_01/sdk-intro.ipynb)) that guides you through the process of setting up the SDK, sending text prompts, receiving text responses, and generating audio output.
    *   This chapter is ideal for developers new to the Gemini API or those who prefer the convenience of an SDK.

*   **[`chapter_02`](chapter_02)**: **Live Audio Chat with Gemini**
    *   This chapter presents a more advanced application: a real-time, two-way audio chat application built using the Gemini Multimodal Live API and the Python SDK.
    *   The Python script (`audio-to-audio.py`) demonstrates how to capture audio from the user's microphone, send it to the API in chunks, receive the model's audio response, and play it back in real time.
    *   This chapter delves into concepts like asynchronous programming, audio chunking, Voice Activity Detection (VAD), and managing the flow of a live conversation.
    *   The [`README.md`](chapter_02/README.md) file accompanying the script provides a comprehensive explanation of these concepts and how they are implemented.

*   **[`chapter_03`](chapter_03)**: **Low-Level WebSocket Interaction - Single Exchange Example**
    *   This chapter dives deeper into the underlying communication mechanism by demonstrating how to interact with the Gemini API using raw WebSockets, without relying on any SDK.
    *   It provides a simple HTML file ([`index.html`](chapter_03/index.html)) that establishes a WebSocket connection, sends a single hardcoded text message to the Gemini model, and displays the model's text response.
    *   This chapter is particularly useful for developers who need a more granular understanding of the API's communication protocol or those who need to integrate the API into environments where an SDK might not be available or suitable. It showcases the mandatory setup message exchange, which is crucial for establishing a session with the API.
    *   The concepts of this chapter are explained in detail in the [`README.md`](chapter_03/README.md) file.

*   **[`chapter_04`](chapter_04)**: **Text-to-Speech with WebSockets**
    *   This chapter demonstrates a practical application of the Gemini API's text-to-speech capabilities, again using a low-level WebSocket connection for communication.
    *   It provides an HTML file ([`index.html`](chapter_04/index.html)) that allows you to enter text, send it to the Gemini model, and receive an audio response that is played directly in your browser.
    *   This example showcases how to handle audio output from the API, decode it, and use the browser's `AudioContext` API to manage audio playback. It includes a queueing mechanism to ensure audio chunks are played sequentially.
    *   You'll learn about concepts like base64 audio decoding, PCM audio format conversion, and the intricacies of real-time audio playback in a web browser.
    *   The accompanying [`README.md`](chapter_04/README.md) file within the `chapter_04` directory provides a detailed explanation of the code and the underlying principles.

*   **[`chapter_05`](chapter_05)**: **Live Audio Chat with WebSockets - Advanced Audio Handling**
    *   This chapter combines the concepts from previous chapters to present a sophisticated real-time audio-to-audio chat application, implemented entirely in the browser using WebSockets and the Web Audio API.
    *   It features an HTML file (`index.html`) along with JavaScript modules for audio recording (`audio-recorder.js`), audio playback (`audio-streamer.js`), and an AudioWorklet for efficient audio processing (`audio-recording-worklet.js`).
    *   This chapter tackles advanced topics like live microphone input, bidirectional audio streaming, intricate audio format conversions, precise audio chunking, and robust state management for interruptions and turn-taking.
    *   The detailed `README.md` file in `chapter_05` provides an in-depth tutorial on building such an application, explaining the design choices, trade-offs, and best practices discovered during development.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Prerequisites:**
    *   For the first four chapters you'll need a [Google Developer API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
    *   Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed for running the Jupyter Notebook and Python scripts.
2. **Start with Chapter 1:** If you're new to the Gemini API, it's recommended to begin with `chapter_01`. The Jupyter Notebook will guide you through the basics of using the SDK.
3. **Dive into Chapter 2:** `chapter_02` presents a more complex application using the Python SDK. You can run the `audio_chat.py` script after installing the required dependencies (listed in the script) and setting your API key as an environment variable or directly in the code (not recommended for production).
4. **Explore Chapter 3:** Move on to `chapter_03` to understand the underlying WebSocket communication. Open the `index.html` file in your browser and examine the JavaScript code along with the accompanying `README.md`.
5. **Experiment with Chapter 4:** Open the `index.html` file from `chapter_04` in your browser. Follow the instructions in the chapter's `README.md` to input text and hear the generated audio.
6. **Tackle Chapter 5:** Open the `index.html` file from `chapter_05` in your browser. Follow the instructions in the chapter's `README.md` to start the audio chat.
7. **Further Exploration:** Feel free to modify the code examples, experiment with different parameters (e.g., `CHUNK_SIZE`, `SEND_SAMPLE_RATE`), and explore the API documentation to deepen your understanding.
